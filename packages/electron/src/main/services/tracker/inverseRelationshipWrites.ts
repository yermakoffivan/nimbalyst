/**
 * Inverse relationship propagation (Epic C, Phase 3).
 *
 * When a source item's relationship field that declares an `inverseFieldId`
 * changes, the inverse value must be materialized on each affected target item's
 * inverse field — e.g. setting plan.dependsOn += bug means bug.blockedBy += plan.
 * The design (`tracker-relationships-design.md`, "bidirectional relationships
 * need a complete write path") calls for updating inverse fields in one service
 * transaction rather than leaving inverse links derive-only.
 *
 * This module owns the orchestration but stays I/O-agnostic via injected deps so
 * it is unit-testable without a DB or the sync stack. The pure delta math lives
 * in the runtime model (`computeInverseFieldDeltas`).
 *
 * Loop safety: target updates are applied through `deps.applyTargetUpdate`, NOT
 * by re-entering the source write path, so an inverse write never triggers its
 * own inverse propagation back to the source.
 *
 * Cross-room limitation (by design): if a target item is not present locally
 * (private to another member, or in a different shared room) it is skipped — the
 * link remains visible from the source side and renders as a backlink/dangler on
 * the other side. No storage model fixes shared-room A ↔ shared-room B for free.

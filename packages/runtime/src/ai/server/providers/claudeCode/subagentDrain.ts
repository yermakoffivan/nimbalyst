// `result` chunk (turn end) while the sub-agent is still running. The streaming
// loop used to break immediately on `result`, so the sub-agent's later
// `task_notification` was never read and its stdin was torn down — killing it and
// leaving the orchestrator idle forever. See NIM-1344 / GitHub #732.

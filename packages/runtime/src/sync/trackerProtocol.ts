 *   crash-safe: we write the queue row FIRST so a process crash before
 *   the projection write still leaves a record bootstrap can replay.
 *   On bootstrap, `pendingApply` rows trigger `applyOptimistic` and get
 *   promoted to `persistedEnqueue`.
 * - `created`: the optimistic local apply has happened but the row has
 *   not yet been moved into `queued`. Exists as its own state to handle
 *   tab-crash mid-enqueue when the legacy (non-atomic) entry point is
 *   used: on relaunch, `created` rows get promoted to `queued` and
 *   submitted.
 * - `queued`: the row is ready to send; waiting for an open WebSocket.
 * - `executing`: the row has been sent; waiting for `trackerMutationAck`.
 * - `persistedEnqueue`: the row was enqueued AND the projection was
 *   applied. Reached via `applyAndEnqueueAtomically` (or replay of a
 *   `pendingApply` row on bootstrap). The durability guarantee
 *   originally claimed by this state now actually holds.
 *

 *   accepted = true  -> row is deleted (the projection in `tracker_items`
